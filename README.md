This app was built out of frustration of daily call-outs for tea and coffee orders at my workplace. 
It solves the problem by having the orders in one place, before the chaiwala comes to take the order. It is also connect to apps script, meaning a google sheet called "Responses" where I can look at the timestamp and names of the people.
